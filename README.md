# BITACORA API

This API is made to keep everthing that matters to you in a save place. With **BITACORA** you could store important info about your future projects, set your pending books' list or remember easily webs you want to take a look at.

## Entities

- **Projects**. A project is something that you want to finish in the future, but it can be easily postponed over and over so it will never be done. That's why you have to include your desired projects in **BITACORA**: name,  description, end date, tools or technologies to use and the steps that you are following to achieve your goals.
- **Books**. Keep your books' list save so you don't have to worry about which one will be your next reading. Don't forget to set the name, author, description, actual price and purchase link.
- **Articles**. There's always a blog or a tutorial you want to check, but it is never the right time. This will never happen again if you store your pending articles - with its title, author, link and description - in **BITACORA**.

## Features

Every entity will have its own set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. This means you can build your desired environment easily, following the typical way to interact with a system.

It probably sounds a bit simple, so more solutions are available to improve the user experience:

- **Alerts**. You can configure a set of alerts (daily, weekly, monthly) for your projects, books and articles and **BITACORA** will notify you by email.
- **Telegram**. The system will use the Telegram API to make easier to manage your records: create new projects, add new books to the list or collect one more article with a simple text message.
